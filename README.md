At Mike Lindell's cybersymposium, he invited "cyber experts" to come and validate his "packet captures".
At around 1pm, he sent the cyber experts to breakout rooms to analyze the "packet captures".

This is what he gave us. They consisted of `HEX.txt` files.

We had to decode these with `xxd -r -p` into binary files, which turned out to be RTF files. I include
these files here.

Text appears to be UTF-16 encoding of Chinese characters, which I don't understand.

So far, he has failed to give us any packet captures from the election.
